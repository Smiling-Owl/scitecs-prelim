            <p>
                Willis Haviland Carrier developed the first modern electrical air conditioning system to control temperature and humidity in a printing plant, 
                which revolutionized climate control in buildings and industrial processes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="text">Date or year of invention</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                Willis Carrier, who worked as an engineer at the Buffalo (NY) Forge Company invented the AC unit in 1902 in which he was given the task of solving a big humidity 
                problem in a Brooklyn publishing company that made magazine pages wrinkle.
            </p>

        <h3 id="text">The Invention</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                The invention of the air conditioning unit by Willis Carrier in 1902 was driven by the economic conditions of industrialization and urbanization, 
                which created a need for climate control in manufacturing and large buildings. 
                Culturally and socially, there was a growing demand for improved comfort and productivity in workplaces, as well as heightened awareness of health impacts from poor air quality.
                 This combination of factors led to the development of air conditioning as a solution to stabilize temperature and humidity.

        <h3 id="text">Impacts</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                The invention of the air conditioning unit had profound impacts across various domains. 
                Economically, it boosted productivity by improving working conditions and stimulated the growth of new industries, including HVAC services. 
                Culturally, it enhanced comfort in homes, offices, and public spaces, contributing to a higher quality of life and enabling the development of skyscrapers and large commercial buildings. 
                Socially, it improved health by reducing heat-related illnesses and enhanced living conditions, making previously less habitable regions more comfortable. 
                Politically, the rise of air conditioning led to new regulations and standards for building codes and environmental controls. 
                Overall, air conditioning transformed daily life, influencing urban development, economic growth, and social patterns.
