                There is no Single inventor of Artificial Intelligence since Ai is a complex field that has evovled over the years through the contributions 
                of numerous Scientist,Mathematician, and engineers. But there are some Pioneers who had contributed the most for the development of artificial intelligence:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alan Turing</li>
                <li>John McCarthy</li>
                <li>Marvin Minsky</li>
                <li>Arthur Samuel</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 id="text">Date or year of invention</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                There is no specific date or year that can pinpoint the exact creation or invention of AI. 
                Its more Accurate to think of AI as a continuous development rather than a Single invention.

        <h3 id="text">The Invention</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                Socially, it is the growing demand for automation as well as the rapid change of demographic. Politically, the government also helped by sustaining considerable
                amout of the fundngs for the development of artificial intelligence. Geopolitical competition also fueled the rapid development of this field. Culturally, it is simply the 
                belief of progress held by the people.

        <h3 id="text">Impacts</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence has helped improve  the efficiency of work, personalized services, but also job displacement and privacy concerns.  It had 
                enhanced governance, national security, but also challenges in regulation and accountability. Artificial Intelligence also brought  
                New industries, job creation, increased efficiency, but also job displacement and economic inequality.
