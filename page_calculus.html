                                Newton has been said to have developed the core concepts of calculus around the 1660s. Despite this fact, he did not publish his work. His first work was published in 1687 with Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). 
                                He then published a more detailed exposition of his ventures in statistics in his 1704 Opticks.

                                Leibniz, on the other hand, published his work in 1684 with his paper Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus 
                                (A New Method for Maxima and Minima, and Also for Tangents)

        <div class="info">
            <p>
                The different elements that are present in calculus have been discovered long before the publications of what is known as Calculus today. The reason as to why these elements were developed varies. Some would be because of its inherent practical application, some are due to being captivated by the craft. 
                There are various conditions that are involved , however a common element amongst all of them are the apparent thirst for knowledge by the discoverers.

        <h3 id="text">Impacts</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                The impact of Calculus in the present day, while not too obvious, is incredibly apparent. 
                One should simply look at its applications and realize that these applications are the foundation of scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements
