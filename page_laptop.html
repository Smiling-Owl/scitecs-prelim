                Adam Osborne was the first inventor of laptop, 
                while Alan Kay was known to be “The Father of all Personal Computers” as he was the one who conceptualized and envisioned a small computing system in 1970s

            <p>
                Adam Osborne invented the laptop in 1981. Though Osborne 1 was recognized as the first laptop, 
                the concept of a portable computer was given in 1968 by Alan Kay.

        <h3 id="text">The Invention</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                In the mid-70s, Osborne became a computer hobbyist and self-published computer manuals—including one for Intel'sicroprocessor. 
                In 1972, he founded Osborne and Associates, a company that created simple, easy-to-read computer manuals. 
                By 1977, the company had published over 400 titles.In 1979, Osborne sold the company and began writing articles for computer magazines.
                Around this time, he became increasingly sure that computers could never be helpful until they were more mobile.
                He was convinced that computers needed to be small and light enough to move with their users and be available anywhere.
